# Ramsey_Growth
Version 0.8

The file solves the textbook Ramsey growth model in continous time by policy function iteration. 
The toolbox is able to plot both the phase diagram of the Ramsey model and the impulse responses after a persistent technology shock.

In order to run the file you have to install python and jupyer notebook on your machine. 
Then download the jupyter notebook in this repository and open the notebook. You should be able to run the model for a pre-specified calibration both under a "low productivity" state and a persistent technology shock that brings the model to the "high productivity" state.

This version is still work in progress. Currently I am working on the implementation of the impulse responses to a transitory technology shock.
